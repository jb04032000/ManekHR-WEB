# Zari360 Connect - Master Build Plan (v2)

> Working file. On execution, copied to `docs/connect/connect-build-plan.md` in both
> `zari360-connect` worktrees. All git / build / edit work happens in the
> `zari360-connect` worktrees only - `crewroster-web/` and `crewroster-backend/` on
> `main` stay untouched.

**v2 revisions** (folded in after review): Phase 0 slimmed (just-in-time component
build); **public SEO route tree added**; Socket.IO moved to Phase 3; feature-flag +
rollout system added to Phase 0; onboarding intents flag-gated; Day-1 suggestions
bootstrap via curated list; mobile-first made the primary design target; per-phase
acceptance criteria + hardening sub-checklists added; Phase 8 shrunk to cross-cutting;
backend-reuse claims become a Phase 0 audit; seed script + error boundaries added.

## Context

**What.** Zari360 Connect is the public-facing layer on top of the Zari360 ERP - a
professional network, marketplace, and jobs board for the Surat embroidery industry.
The ERP (attendance / payroll / finance, 41 backend modules) is production-ready.
Connect today is a single "coming soon" placeholder at `/platform`.

**Why now.** Connect is the growth surface. The moat is the _ERP-linked_ signal: a
workshop that actively runs payroll/attendance in the ERP is provably real, surfaced
as a trust badge across every Connect screen. No competitor (IndiaMART, Naukri, Apna)
has operational factory data. Connect turns ERP usage into distribution.

**Inputs absorbed.** `zari360_connect_design_decisions.md` (locked design spec -
tiebreaker), `zari360_connect_features.md` (feature inventory / competitor research),
`Zari360 Connect Wireframes.html` + 14 `connect-*.jsx` sketches (26 screens, ~20
reusable patterns - pixel source of truth), full web + backend worktree audits.

**Shape.** Multi-month, 9 phases (0–8), built as **full-stack vertical slices** -
each phase ships one module complete: backend + frontend desktop + mobile + empty
states, nothing mocked. Each phase ships **behind a feature flag** so it can go to a
closed beta before GA. Each phase gets a detailed sub-plan + owner review checkpoint.

---

## Identity architecture - ERP ↔ Connect (locked)

> Full detail + edge cases: `docs/connect/IDENTITY-MODEL.md` (canonical).

**Connect is a standalone product. ERP is a separate product. The moat is a link
between them, not a parent-child hierarchy.** "Workspace" is an ERP word - Connect has
no Workspace concept.

**Connect's four primitives:**

| Primitive        | Cardinality   | What it is                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `User`           | 1 per person  | Identity + login. Shared by ERP and Connect.                             |
| `ConnectProfile` | 1 per `User`  | The person's LinkedIn-style page. Person-scoped, always you.             |
| `CompanyPage`    | 0..N per User | Standalone public **business identity** (hires, posts). Own admin + URL. |
| `Storefront`     | 0..N per User | Standalone public **sales catalog** (sells, leads). Own admin + URL.     |

`CompanyPage` and `Storefront` are **parallel sibling entities** - same shape (owner,
slug, public page, admin dashboard, optional ERP link), different purpose. A `User`
owns any number of each, none, or a mix.

- One `User`, one login; ERP↔Connect are modes of the _same_ session. No separate
  "Connect account". Shared identity (name, avatar, mobile) is canonical on `User`,
  _read_ by Connect; never copied onto Connect collections.
- **ERP integration is an opt-in per-entity link.** A `CompanyPage` / `Storefront`
  may set `erpWorkspaceId` to earn the **ERP-linked badge**, derived from that
  workspace's activity. A `ConnectProfile` shows ERP-linked context from the User's
  _employment_ (`WorkspaceMember` active rows) - never a field on the profile.
- Connect is **not gated on ERP** - a karigar with no ERP gets a full `ConnectProfile`
  and can even create a `Storefront`.
- The **ERP-linked badge is derived, never stored** - `ErpLinkService` computes it
  from workspace activity (≥5 attendance OR 1 payroll run OR 3 invoices in 30 days;
  60-day silent decay - design doc §9.1), invoked per linked entity.
- **Privacy wall:** ERP operational data (salary, attendance rows) **never** auto-leaks
  to any public Connect surface - only what the user explicitly puts there + the
  derived ERP-linked _boolean_.

**Key edge cases** (full table in `IDENTITY-MODEL.md`):

| Case                                         | Handling                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `User` with no ERP                           | Full `ConnectProfile`; may own Company Pages / Storefronts; no ERP-linked badge. Works fully.  |
| `User` active in ERP workspace(s)            | Profile shows ERP-linked context from employment; multiple employments OR'd, **no "primary"**. |
| Entity not linked to ERP                     | Valid entity, no badge. The link is opt-in, set in the entity's admin settings.                |
| One `Workspace` linked from several entities | Allowed - a workshop's Company Page + Storefront may both link the same workspace.             |
| `TeamMember` with no `linkedUserId`          | Workshop-curated _claimable_ listing; "Invite to Connect" sets `linkedUserId`.                 |
| `Workspace` / account deletion               | ERP-linked badge decays silently; Connect entities cascade on `User` delete.                   |

## Tech stack - evaluated

**Adopt (new, free, open-source):**
| Tech | Use | Introduced |
|------|-----|-----------|
| TanStack Query | Client cache / optimistic / **polling** (badge counts P1–2). Hybrid - Server Components + server actions still own initial loads | P0 |
| Zod | DTO + form schema validation | P0 |
| Framer Motion | Composer sheets, voice UI, transitions | P0 |
| `lucide-react` | Connect icon set - matches wireframe `CIco`. ERP keeps `@ant-design/icons` | P0 |
| **Socket.IO** (NestJS gateway) | Live feed updates + notification push (P3); typing/presence/live threads (P7) | **P3** |
| Redis 7+ | BullMQ store + Socket.IO adapter + presence | P3 |
| BullMQ | Feed fan-out, notification batching, digest emails | P3 |
| Meilisearch (self-hosted) | Search - **provisioned P2** (people search); each later module registers its index as it ships | P2 |
| TanStack Virtual | Feed + long-list virtualization | P3 |

**Reject / diverge:** date-fns → use existing `dayjs`. Biome → keep ESLint 9 +
Prettier. Tiptap → deferred (textarea v1; only if the long-form Article composer is
built). Storybook → deferred; in-app `/design-system` route instead. AntD → use
installed **v6.3.2** (not v5). Next.js → installed **16.1.6**. recharts → already
installed.

**Infra (ops track, not code):** DO/Hetzner, Docker Compose, Caddy/Nginx, PM2, GitHub
Actions, Grafana/Prometheus, self-hosted PostHog. Sentry + PostHog SDKs already wired.

## Design system & tokens

`zari360_connect_design_decisions.md` is the locked spec - every screen inherits it.

**Token audit - verified:** the wireframe `tokens.css` `:root` palette is
byte-identical to the repo's `app/globals.css --cr-*` vars + `tailwind.config.js`
(indigo-600 `#1A2A6C`, indigo-700 `#142158`, gold-500 `#C9A227`, cream `#FAF8F3`,
full neutral + semantic scales). So:

- **Reuse** the existing system as-is - `--cr-*` CSS vars, `lib/theme.ts` AntD
  `ConfigProvider`, `tailwind.config.js`, the `@theme` map. **Redefine nothing.**
- **Add** only Connect tokens, namespaced `--cn-*`, layered on `--cr-*`:
  `--cn-whatsapp` `#25D366`, `--cn-whatsapp-hover` `#128C7E`, `--cn-badge-erp-bg`
  (indigo-800), `--cn-badge-erp-fg` (gold-400). GST/Udyam badge colors already exist.
- Prototype `connect.css` is **not** ported - recreate the _visual output_ with AntD +
  Tailwind + tokens (per handoff README).

## Route map (v2 - public SEO tree + authenticated app)

### Public route group - `app/(connect-public)/`

SSR / ISR, **indexable** (sitemap + robots), light public chrome + "Join Connect" CTA.
Works logged-out (SEO + conversion). Logged-in users get the full interactive Connect
shell on the same canonical URL. These are the shareable / WhatsApp-link / SEO pages.

| Route                   | Screen                          | Phase |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----- |
| `/u/[userId]`           | Person profile (public view)    | P1    |
| `/company/[slug]`       | Company page                    | P6    |
| `/store/[slug]`         | Seller storefront               | P4    |
| `/products/[productId]` | Product detail                  | P4    |
| `/jobs/[jobId]`         | Job detail                      | P5    |
| `sitemap.ts` · `robots` | Indexing infra (group scaffold) | P0    |

### Authenticated app - `app/connect/*` (Connect shell, `mode="connect"`)

Personal / interactive surfaces. Module tabs are one route with URL-synced `?tab=`;
the server-component shell does not remount on tab change. (`/connect` itself is the
public marketing landing - the app index is `/connect/home`.)

| Route                          | Screen                                                                             | Phase |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| `/connect/home`                | Smart entry - coming-soon / onboarding / Day-1 home (flag-gated)                   | P0/P1 |
| `/connect/onboarding`          | Intent flow                                                                        | P1    |
| `/connect/profile`             | Own profile (view / edit) - Person-scoped                                          | P1    |
| `/connect/feed`                | Connect Home - Feed                                                                | P3    |
| `/connect/network?tab=`        | Network - Invitations / Connections / Following / Suggestions                      | P2    |
| `/connect/marketplace?tab=`    | Marketplace - Browse / RFQ Board (personal browsing)                               | P4    |
| `/connect/jobs?tab=`           | Jobs - Find Jobs / My Applications (personal job-seeking)                          | P5    |
| `/connect/store/[slug]/manage` | **Storefront admin** - Dashboard / Products / Leads / Quotes / Settings (`?tab=`)  | P4    |
| `/connect/page/[slug]/manage`  | **Company Page admin** - Dashboard / Posts / Jobs / Followers / Settings (`?tab=`) | P6    |
| `/connect/inbox?thread=`       | Unified inbox (Person-scoped - all roles)                                          | P7    |
| `/connect/notifications`       | Notifications center + preferences (Person-scoped)                                 | P7    |
| `/connect/search?q=&type=`     | Unified search results                                                             | P2    |
| `/connect/settings`            | Connect settings (notification prefs, privacy, saved searches)                     | P1+   |
| `/design-system`               | Component gallery (dev-only / admin-gated)                                         | P0    |

**Entity-scoped vs Person-scoped.** `Lead Manager`, `Posted Jobs`, `Candidates` are
**not** top-level routes - they are sub-tabs **inside an entity's admin context**
(Leads / Quotes inside a Storefront; Posted-Jobs / Candidates inside a Company Page).
Each owned `CompanyPage` / `Storefront` is reached by its name in the sidebar (no
workspace switcher, no active context). Composers (post / product / job / RFQ / voice
/ WhatsApp handoff) are **modal sheets, not routes**, and carry an explicit "Post as"
identity selector (Self / an owned Company Page / an owned Storefront).

---

## Shared component inventory

`components/connect/*` - compose existing `components/ui/Ds*` primitives (`DsButton`,
`DsCard`, `DsModal`, `DsDrawer`, `DsAvatar`, `DsTag`, `DsTable`, `DsInput`,
`DsEmptyState`), never duplicate. **Built just-in-time** - only the Phase-0 set is
pre-built; the rest are built in the phase that first needs them, then added to
`/design-system`. (Avoids rebuilding e.g. `PipelineColumn` if wireframes evolve.)

**Phase 0 - pre-built (shell + cross-cutting primitives only):**
`ConnectModuleNav` · `ConnectMobileTabBar` · `ConnectTopBar` · `ConnectSearchBar` ·
`TrustBadgeRow` · `ConnectEmptyState` · `WhatsAppCTA` · `ConnectErrorBoundary`
(+ route-level `error.tsx`).

**Just-in-time - built in the noted phase:**
`PersonCard`, `ProfileStrengthCard`, `ERPLinkedPanel`, `ERPCallout`, `RateRow`,
`ContactPreferenceSelector` (P1) · `ModuleTabs` (P2) · `PostCard`, `Composer` (with
the "Post as" identity selector), `VoiceNoteRecorder`, `MediaUploadGrid`,
`RightRailPanel`/`RailMiniList` (P3) · **business-entity foundation** -
`EntityAdminShell` + `EntityScopeBar`, `CreateEntityWizard`, `ErpLinkSetting`,
`OwnedEntitySidebarGroup` - plus `ProductCard`, `RFQCard`, `LeadCard`,
`QuotationCard`, `StickyActionBar` (P4) · `JobCard`, `PipelineColumn`,
`CallerIDBanner` (P5) · `CompanyCard` (P6) · `ContextBar`, `WhatsAppHandoffModal`
(P7). Maps design-doc §15 + wireframe patterns.

> **`ConnectModuleNav` reframe** - the Phase-0 shell sidebar is updated to render the
> owned-entity directory: a `YOUR PRESENCE` group (My Profile) plus conditional
> `COMPANY PAGES` and `STOREFRONTS` groups, each listing owned entities by name with
> a `+ Create` CTA (or a single "Create your business presence" CTA when both are
> empty). No workspace switcher; no active context. `EntityAdminShell` /
> `EntityScopeBar` and the create wizards are the **parallel foundation shared by
> Company Page and Storefront** - built once in Phase 4, reused by Phase 6.

**Reuse - verify, don't assert.** Phase 0 deliverable: audit `notifications`,
`uploads`, `audit`, `subscriptions` modules and **confirm the reuse plan or surface
deltas**. Expected: `uploads` (R2 - add `audio` category), `notifications` (new event
types), `mail`/`sms`, `auth`/`users`, `audit`, `subscriptions` reused; `users`
extended (`connectEnabled` flag). **`workspaces` is NOT extended** - `CompanyPage` /
`Storefront` are standalone Connect entities (own collections, own slug) that merely
hold an optional `erpWorkspaceId` reference; `ErpLinkService` reads workspace activity
read-only. The Connect public slug/metadata lives on the Connect entity, never on the
ERP `Workspace`.

Conventions every new module follows: `JwtAuthGuard` + guards, class-validator + Zod
DTOs, throttler tiers, `AuditService` logging, PostHog events, OpenTelemetry spans,
Sentry capture, `*.vitest.ts` tests, env via config loader.

## Feature flags & rollout (new - Phase 0)

Three layers, no new paid dependency:

1. **Module enablement** - a `connectModules` config (env / small JSON): which Connect
   modules are live. Drives onboarding intent availability and `/connect` nav.
2. **Per-user access** - `User.connectEnabled`. **Rollout policy:** admin-controlled
   during closed beta (admin panel toggle) → self-serve opt-in at onboarding once GA
   → default-on at GA. The `/connect/home` "coming soon" branch _is_ the not-enabled
   state - no redirect needed; flag-on users get the smart entry.
3. **Cohort / % rollout** - PostHog feature flags (PostHog already wired, free) for
   closed-beta cohorts and gradual percentage rollout.
4. **Entitlements (reserved for monetization)** - beyond module on/off, the registry
   enumerates _capability_ entries for the would-be paid surface: owning a
   `CompanyPage` (**business** identity), owning a `Storefront` (**selling**), and
   **marketing** tools (boosted posts / promoted listings). Each is a gateable
   entitlement with room for a per-tier _limit_ (e.g. free = 1 Company Page + 1
   Storefront; paid tiers raise the cap and unlock marketing). **No billing is built
   now** - the registry structure is reserved so a future subscription tier can charge
   for business / selling / marketing capacity without rework. Entitlement entries are
   wired with the entity foundation (Phase 4) and reuse the existing `subscriptions`
   module; until then every capability is unlimited / free.

Each phase ships behind its module flag → closed beta (10–50 workshop owners) →
feedback → GA.

## Phased build order

Each phase = backend + frontend desktop + **mobile-first** + empty states + 4-locale
i18n, full-stack, behind a feature flag. One screen end-to-end before the next. Each
phase gets a detailed sub-plan (acceptance criteria + task breakdown) and an owner
review checkpoint.

**Every phase carries a hardening sub-checklist** (done _within_ the phase, not
deferred): analytics events emitted (design-doc §16) · WCAG-AA self-audit · i18n
complete in all 4 locales · perf budget checked · seed data updated · demo / handoff
note for internal team.

## Per-phase acceptance criteria

Each phase sub-plan defines **3–5 acceptance criteria as user-observable outcomes** -
what the owner checks against at the review checkpoint (not vibes).

**Template:** `A [persona] can [action] and [observe result], in [locale], at [380px /
desktop].`

**Phase 1 example:**

1. A new user opens Connect, picks an intent, and lands on the right next screen
   (built intents proceed; unbuilt ones show honest "coming soon").
2. A user completes a profile - headline, photo, ≥3 skills, ≥1 portfolio item - and
   sees it rendered, in their chosen locale, at 380px and desktop.
3. The profile is reachable at its public `/u/[id]` URL, server-rendered and
   indexable, working logged-out with a "Join Connect" CTA.
4. A profile shows the **ERP-linked** badge when its `User` is an active member of an
   ERP workspace (derived from employment); a user with no ERP does not.
5. The Day-1 home shows a curated discovery list to follow (Company Pages once they
   exist - Phase 6; a bootstrap stand-in until then).

---

## Standing engineering standards (the reusable contract)

Saved to memory + `docs/connect/ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md`. Binding on every Connect
change - the owner should not need to repeat these.

1. **TypeScript strict - zero `any`.** No `@ts-ignore`. `tsc` clean before a phase closes.
2. **ESLint clean** - incl. `eslint-plugin-i18next`. No warnings.
3. **i18n every user-facing string** via `next-intl`. All four locales (`en`, `gu`,
   `gu-en`, `hi-en`) populated with real translations each phase - no English stubs.
   `scripts/check-i18n.js` (prebuild gate) must pass.
4. **Mobile-first - the primary design target.** Build the mobile layout first from
   the mobile wireframes (380px), then scale up to desktop as the responsive
   expansion. Never "build desktop, check mobile." Verified at 380 / 768 / 1280px.
5. **Reuse before build.** Compose `components/ui/Ds*` + `components/connect/`. Never
   duplicate. Lift reusable ERP code to a shared location rather than copying.
6. **AntD-first**, themed via `lib/theme.ts` `ConfigProvider`. Tailwind for layout
   utilities on custom elements only. Recreate wireframe visuals - don't port CSS.
7. **Next.js the right way** - Server Components for initial data, server actions for
   mutations, route handlers for webhooks. TanStack Query for interactive client
   surfaces. Public entity pages are SSR/ISR + indexable.
8. **No needless re-renders** - URL-synced tabs swap content without remounting the
   shell; stable callbacks / `React.memo` on list rows; `useDeferredValue` + debounce
   on search; virtualize long lists.
9. **Every screen has empty / loading / error states** + an **error boundary**
   (`ConnectErrorBoundary` / route `error.tsx`). Indian numbering for currency
   (`₹4,49,500`).
10. **No shortcuts, no stubs, no TODOs, no "future implementation."** A feature ships
    complete or it is not in the phase.
11. **Every new shared component** is rendered on `/design-system` in isolation.
12. **No git operations by the assistant** - the owner stages and commits.
13. **Logical changes** (new schema / module / permission model) surfaced for explicit
    approval; their _content_ is the assistant's call after research.
14. **Paid dependencies** flagged prominently at development time - owner decides.
15. **Per-phase hardening** - analytics events, WCAG self-audit, i18n completeness,
    perf budget, seed data, demo note done _within_ the phase, never stockpiled.
16. **Every phase ships behind a feature flag.** Verification before "done" - evidence,
    not assertion.

## Artifacts to create (Phase 0)

- `docs/connect/connect-build-plan.md` - this plan, both worktrees.
- `docs/connect/ENGINEERING-STANDARDS.md` - the 16-point contract.
- `docs/connect/IDENTITY-MODEL.md` - identity decision + edge cases.
- `/design-system` route - component gallery (populated as components are built).
- `seed:connect` script - realistic demo fixtures (profiles, workshops, posts) for
  stakeholder demos.
- PostHog **Connect funnel dashboard** definition - events from §16 feed it per phase.
- **Memory entries:** `project_connect_epic`, `feedback_connect_engineering_standards`,
  `project_connect_identity_model`.
- **Execution harness:** drive each phase with `/gsd-plan-phase` → `/gsd-execute-phase`.

---

## Verification (every phase)

- **Backend:** `tsc` clean · `vitest` green · `eslint` clean.
- **Web:** `tsc` strict clean (no `any`) · `eslint` clean (incl. i18next) ·
  `check:i18n` passes · `next build` passes.
- **Manual:** every screen at **380 / 768 / 1280px**; empty + loading + error states;
  keyboard nav; wireframe matched for layout & copy.
- **Acceptance criteria** (3–5 per phase) demonstrably met.
- **`/design-system`** renders every new component without error.
- **Playwright E2E** for the phase's critical flow.
- Public pages: server-rendered, indexable, work logged-out.
- **Owner review checkpoint** after each route/phase; flag any decision the design
  docs did not cover. The owner runs all `git` commits.
